        Kr8s (pronounced “crates”) is an open-source developer tool that quickly integrates and simplifies Kubernetes cluster monitoring, helping you keep an eye on the health of your microservice application.
        <br>
        Through seamless integration of its core technologies, Kr8s offers a sophisticated solution for developers looking for out of the box functionality and reliability. Distributed via Electron, Kr8s installs as a standalone desktop application for MacOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.

        Upon opening the application, the landing page prompts you to connect to your local running Kubernetes cluster. Once connected, you are redirected to the Dashboard page where data immediately populates into a selection of visualizers refreshing on a 15 second interval. This view offers an at-a-glance, high-level overview of the overall health and function of your cluster.

        The Pods Menu assembles an array of relevant metrics and container information, as well as a list of all deployed pods and their current statuses. You are able to click on a pod in the list to open a Pod View page, displaying the selected pod and child container information.

        Kr8s functionality assumes that you have Docker and Kubernetes already installed and running on your machine.
        If your machine does not have these setup, the simplest way to install both is to follow the instructions for <a class="topicLink" href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker Desktop</a> installation, then enable Kubernetes from the Settings menu based on your operating system.
        <br><br>
        <i class="started-heading">If you don't have your own locally running cluster:</i>
        If you are interested in trying out Kr8s, but do not yet have a running Kubernetes cluster, we created a rudimentary microservices application you can use to test features. Simply clone the <a href="https://github.com/oslabs-beta/kr8sdemo">kr8sdemo</a> repository and follow the instruction in the README.
        <br><br>
        <i class="started-heading">Once there is a running cluster on your machine:</i>
        Download and install the Kr8s application in the <a href="#download">download section</a>.
        Open the application and select "Local Cluster" to connect to the running cluster on your machine. Kr8s will take care of everything from there to make the connections behind the scenes and get Prometheus and Grafana up and running with your cluster!
